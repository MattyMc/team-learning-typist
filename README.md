# Team Learning | Typist

At Typist, we believe that personal growth and learning is one of the largest contributors to professional success, job performance, and happiness at work. We dedicate each Thursday morning to our learning by following an established, thoughtful, and evolving process that is outlined below. Our purpose is to maximize our teams' professional learning. That is, maximizing the collective learning of the team, not the individual. This repository outlines our philosophy for implementing this at Typist, describes patterns and anti-patterns that we believe hinders learning, and serves as an ongoing record of our weekly learning activities. 

## Weekly Learning Log

Each person, each week will record the following data:

  1. Topics (content, course, etc.)  
  2. Measurement of prior knowledge (0-10).   
  3. How cool (i.e. exciting, valuable, fun) is this superpower you learned this week?  
  4. New superpowers! How much did your superpowers grow this week (0-10)? I.e. how much did you learn?   
  5. Types of activities: At least 1 of: Video Lectures, Tutorials, Coding Exercises, [Add new].  
  6. 2-3 bullet points describing what was learned.  
  
### Week 1 - Thursday, May 2nd.

#### Matt

**Topics**: Big O Notation, Analyzing Performance of Arrays and Objects (Sections 1-3) from Udemy Course, [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/).  
**Prior Knowledge**: 4   
**Interest level**: 6.5  
**Growth**: 3   
**Activities**: Video Lectures   
**Learnings**:  
  - What big O notation actually means. Approaching this calculation by simply counting the number of operations inside a function or scope, including variable assignments. 
  - The idea of space complexity was entirely new. 
  - Using Javascript snippets inside of Chrome is super powerful! Great tidbit.

**Topics**: Big O Notation, Analyzing Performance of Arrays and Objects (Sections 1-3) from Udemy Course, [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/).   
**Prior Knowledge**: 4  
**Interest level**: 10  
**Growth**: 1  
**Activities**: Video Lectures  
**Learnings**:  
  - Big O notation being used for space complexity
  - Taking into account that inserting at beginning of array requires re-indexing of the array
  - Google chrome snippets


### Week 2 - Thursday, May 9th.

#### Matt

**Topics**: Problem solving approaches, patterns and problems (Sections 4-6) from Udemy Course, [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/). Additionaly, lots of learning around AWS Lambda.  
**Prior Knowledge**: 4   
**Interest level**: 6.5  
**Growth**: 8.5   
**Activities**: Video Lectures, Coding Exercises   
**Learnings**:  
  - Strategy: Understand the problem (edge cases, assumptions, etc), explore examples, break it down (comment the steps), solve/simplify the problem, look back and refactor.
  - Common problem solving patterns, like frequency counters, sliding windows, duel pointers. These were super helpful to see formally. 
  - Some of the programming challenges kicked my ass. In particular, `minSubArrayLen` and `findLongestSubString`.
  - How AWS Lambda works. Built a few tutorial apps, created a simulator for local development that emulates S3 events, learned about the pros/cons of usage. Also, explored Ruby Jets framework, and the JS serverless framework for building serverless functions.

**Prior Knowledge**: 5    
**Interest level**: 7    
**Growth**: 3     
**Activities**: Video Lectures, Coding Exercises    
**Learnings**:   
  - Learned of more cases for "sliding window" and "multiple pointers" approach
  - Usefulness of "frequency counter" pattern
  - Good set of coding problems (especially liked `averagePair`)

### Superpower Scale for Reference and Fun :)
Ex. 0/10 = No superpower :(  
Ex. 1/10 = Glow in the dark.  
Ex. 2/10 = Hover only 1ft above the ground.  
Ex. 5/10 = Invisibility.  
Ex. 6/10 = Telekinesis.  
Ex. 7/10 = Super strength.   
Ex. 8/10 = Telepathy (reading minds).  
Ex. 9/10 = Regeneration like Wolverine.  
Ex. 10/10 = Taking other superpowers (assuming others have superpowers).
