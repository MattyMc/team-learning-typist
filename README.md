# Team Learning | Typist

At Typist, we believe that personal growth and learning is one of the largest contributors to professional success, job performance, and happiness at work. We dedicate each Thursday morning to our learning by following an established, thoughtful, and evolving process that is outlined below. Our purpose is to maximize our teams' professional learning. That is, maximizing the collective learning of the team, not the individual. This repository outlines our philosophy for implementing this at Typist, describes patterns and anti-patterns that we believe hinders learning, and serves as an ongoing record of our weekly learning activities.

  - What big O notation actually means. Approaching this calculation by simply counting the number of operations inside a function or scope, including variable assignments.
